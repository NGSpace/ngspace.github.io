## Hate the design?

I ain't no artist or frontend dev, it took me 9 months to get NNUEdit to not me feel like I need to take a bath in bleach after I look at it for longer than 3 seconds.

If you know stuff about design however, feel free to make a pull request and make the site look as beautiful as your mean heart desires.
