		<h1>Welcome to the hudder wiki!</h1>
		Hudder is a minecraft mod which allows you to create your own, highly
		customizable hud without prior programming knowledge.<br>
		Hudder also allows more technical people the ability to use complex
		tools that they may be more familiar with (like JavaScript)
		to make their hud.<br>
		Hudder also has a variety of built-in huds that can serve as a base for
		your own hud as well as give you the ability to make as many huds as
		you may wish for.
